## üöÄ Features

### Universal Navigation & Layout
- **Global Tab System:** Persistent, global tab bar for all major sections (Shopify, Pinterest, Design Library, etc.), with open/close/switch and state saved in localStorage.

- **Universal Operation Bar:** Context-aware actions (Download, Upload, etc.) and access to filtered/grouped data.
- **Secondary Sidebar:** Context-sensitive, collapsible sidebar for section navigation.

### DataView Component
- **Highly Customizable:** Table, grid, and card views, with easy-to-modify layout, effects, and spacing via props.
- **Sticky Headers:** Table and grid headers remain visible when scrolling vertically.
- **Field Selection Modals:** Modern, reusable modals (`GridConfigModal`, `CardConfigModal`) for selecting visible fields in grid and card views.
- **Advanced Field Handling:** Supports nested fields, robust image detection, and clickable links in form views.
- **Tag Filtering & Search:** Filter by tags and search by any field.
- **Edit/Delete Modals:** Responsive modals for editing and deleting items.
- **Paginated View:** Supports paginated data loading with a Next button for all major sections.
- **Per-Card Field Customization:** Card view allows per-card field selection with a settings modal for each card.
- **Grid View Customization:** Grid view supports global field selection with a settings modal.
- **Collapsible Nested Form/JSON View:** Modals for row details support collapsible sections for nested data.
- **Modern UI/UX:** All modals and controls use a modern, clean, and accessible design.

### Shopify Section
- **Tabbed Interface:** Orders, Products, and Collections, managed by the universal tab system.

- **Cache Key Structure:** Resource, page size (`limit`), and pagination key (`lastKey`).
- **TTL (Time-to-Live):** Default 5 minutes, configurable.
- **Cache Invalidation:** On any mutation (create/update/delete), relevant cache keys are invalidated.
- **Pagination Support:** Each page of data is cached separately.

## üê≥ Docker & Valkey (Redis-Compatible) Caching

You can use [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) (a Redis-compatible in-memory cache) for local development or production caching.

### docker-compose.yml
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  valkey:
    image: valkey/valkey:latest
    container_name: valkey-cache
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    volumes:
      - valkey-data:/data
    command: valkey-server --appendonly yes
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - app-network

  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: inkhub-admin
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - REDIS_HOST=valkey
      - REDIS_PORT=6379
    depends_on:
      - valkey
    networks:
      - app-network

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  valkey-data:
    driver: local
```

### Dockerfile
```Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Running Locally with Docker
1. **Build and start everything:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
2. The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
3. Valkey will be available at `localhost:6379` for caching.

### Standalone Valkey for Local Dev
If you want to run only Valkey for local dev (not the app):
```bash
docker compose up valkey
```

---

## ‚ö° Cache System
- **Disk LRU Cache:** Used by default for all API routes if Valkey/Redis is not available.
- **Valkey/Redis:** If `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT` are set, the app uses Valkey for caching (see `src/utils/redis.ts`).
- **Config:**
  - Set `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT` in your environment or Docker Compose.
  - Or set `VALKEY_URL=redis://localhost:6379` in `.env.local` for local dev.
- **Cache Utility:** See `src/utils/cache.ts` and `src/utils/redis.ts` for implementation details.
